Datasets
========

The package currently provides the following datasets:

- `SpuCoMNIST`: A dataset for the MNIST task with a spurious feature of background color.
- `SpuCoCXR`: A dataset for detecting pneumonia from chest x-rays with a spurious feature of the presence of medical support devices.
- `SpuCoMedNLI`: A large-scale NLP dataset for identifying spurious correlations in medical notes.

Key Features of SpuCo Datasets:
- Controllable strength of spurious feature 
- Controllable spurious correlation
